# gps-logger
I made gps-logger by pythonista3.
You can check where you are and where you were by using these scripts.

I imported some modules. These modules are ui, location, csv, datetime, time, os, folium, and urljoin.
You need use Stash to install folium, but you don't have to install numpy because numpy is default module in Pythonista3. 

I'm python beginner, so my scripts may are very difficult to read. But I hope the scripts are useful for Pythonista user.
